'''9. Find All IP Addresses in a String
Problem Statement: Write a function to extract all valid IPv4 addresses from a given string. An IPv4 address has the form X.X.X.X, where X is a number between 0 and 255.
Hint:
â€¢	Use the pattern  to match IP addresses and validate that each part is between 0 and 255.

Input Example:
text = "The server's IPs are 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.255, and an invalid IP 999.999.999.999."
Output Example:
['192.168.0.1', '10.0.0.255']
